4. **Monitored** - Continuous health monitoring and alerting

### Key Design Principles
- **Zero Debug Code** in production systems
- **Fail-Safe Operations** with automatic rollback
- **Defensive Programming** with extensive error handling
- **Performance First** with sub-second response requirements
- **Scalability Built-In** for handling thousands of concurrent users

### Security & Compliance
- **COPPA Compliance** for children's data protection
- **Encryption at Rest** and in transit for all sensitive data
- **Input Validation** prevents injection attacks and data corruption
- **Access Logging** provides complete audit trail for security

## 🚀 Integration Examples

```python
from tbv_integration import verify_phone_call

result = verify_phone_call(
    session_id="call-123",
    phone="+1234567890", 
    duration=300
)
# Returns: verified=True/False, confidence=0.95, errors=[]
```

### Story Content Verification  
```python
from tbv_integration import verify_story

result = verify_story(
