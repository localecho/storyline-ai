# 🌍 Customer Accessibility Enhancements

## Target Customer: Non-English Speaking, Busy Parents

Based on user feedback: *"the end user is likely includes a parent who cannot speak english well and or is busy"*

## 🚨 Critical Issues Addressed

### 1. Language Barriers ✅ COMPLETED
**Problem**: English-only interface excludes non-native speakers
**Solution**: 
- Bilingual welcome message (English/Spanish)
- Language selection at call start
- Spanish voice prompts with `language='es-ES'`
- Multilingual story content in database

### 2. Complex Registration Flow ✅ COMPLETED  
**Problem**: Original flow asked too many questions for busy parents
**Solution**:
- Simplified 2-step registration: name + age only
- Removed interests collection (uses defaults: adventure, animals)
- Faster onboarding reduces call abandonment

### 3. Voice Recognition Enhancement 🔄 PENDING
**Problem**: May fail with accented English
**Solutions Needed**:
- Implement Twilio's enhanced speech recognition
- Add phonetic name matching algorithms
- Fallback to DTMF input when speech fails
- Multiple recognition attempts with patience
